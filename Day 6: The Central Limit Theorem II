The number of tickets purchased by each student for the University X vs. University Y football game follows 
a distribution that has a mean of 2.4 and a standard deviation of 2.

A few hours before the game starts, 100 eager students line up to purchase last-minute tickets.
If there are only 250 tickets left, what is the probability that all 100 students will be able to purchase tickets?

mu=2.4
sigma=2
n=100
import math as m
cdf=lambda x: 0.5*(1+m.erf((x-n*mu)/(m.sqrt(2*n)*sigma)))
print(round(cdf(250),4))
