In a certain plant, the time taken to assemble a car is a random variable, X, having a normal distribution with a mean of 20 hours and a standard deviation of 2 hours. What is the probability that a car can be assembled at this plant in:

Less than 19.5 hours?
Between 20 and 22 hours?



import math as m
mu=20
sigma=2
cdf=lambda x:0.5*(1+m.erf((x-mu)/(sigma*m.sqrt(2))))

print('{:.3f}'.format(cdf(19.5)))

print('{:.3f}'.format(cdf(22)-cdf(20)))
