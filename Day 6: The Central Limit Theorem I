A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes
must be transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution
with a mean of 205 pounds and a standard deviation of 15 pounds. Based on this information, 
what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?

import math as m
n=49
mu=205
sigma=15
cdf=lambda x: 0.5*(1+m.erf((x-n*mu)/(m.sqrt(2*n)*sigma)))
print(round(cdf(9800),4))
