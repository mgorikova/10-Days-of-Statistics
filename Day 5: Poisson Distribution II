The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:

1.The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88.
The daily cost of operating A is 
CA=160 + 40X**2

2.The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55.
The daily cost of operating A is 
CB=128 + 40Y**2

Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.

import math as m
l1=0.88
l2=1.55
C1=160+40*(l1+l1**2)
C2=128+40*(l2+l2**2)
print(round(C1,3))
print(round(C2,3))
